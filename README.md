# Web Scraping

This repository contains Python scripts for scraping French text from various websites, including social media platforms, newspapers, and other sources.

I originally wrote these scripts to assemble a corpus for the second edition of *A Frequency Dictionary of French: Core Vocabulary for Learners* (Law & Le Bras, Routledge). These scripts are also used as templates for students in my *Internet French* corpus linguistics course.
